### `Initial Release`
# **Version 1.0**
Toggle Ninja is an application that answers the question: "Did I leave my stove on?".
The functionality of the Toggle Ninja is enjoyably straightforward. Simply add a toggle, set its initial status (ON/OFF) and save it. From there, you can share it with whoever you wish. Any user you wish to share a toggle will have the ability to change its status and the change will be known to you as well.


Features:

- Add a toggle with a name and a status (ON/OFF).
- Import a toggle from another user.
- Edit a toggle's name and/or status.
- Observe all your toggles' statuses.
- Share a toggle of your own.
